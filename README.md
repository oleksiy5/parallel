# Parallel.For
Parallel.For is a method in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace in C# that allows for the parallel execution of a for loop. It uses the .NET Framework's Task Parallel Library (TPL) to divide the loop's iterations across multiple threads, potentially improving performance on multi-core systems. The method takes a ParallelOptions object, which can be used to specify the degree of parallelism and a CancellationToken to cancel the loop.
