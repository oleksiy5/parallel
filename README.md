# Parallel.For

Parallel.For is a method in the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace in C# that allows for the parallel execution of a for loop. It uses the .NET Framework's `Task Parallel Library` (_TPL_) to divide the loop's iterations across multiple threads, potentially improving performance on multi-core systems. The method takes a ParallelOptions object, which can be used to specify the degree of parallelism and a CancellationToken to cancel the loop.

`Task.Factory.StartNew` is a method in the `System.Threading.Tasks` namespace that allows for the creation and execution of a task. A task is a unit of work that can be executed concurrently with other tasks.

`Parallel.For` and `Task.Factory.StartNew` can both be used for parallel execution of code, but `Parallel.For` is typically used for parallelizing loops and Task.Factory.StartNew is used for creating and executing individual tasks.

> In the example, the method performs tasks returns the result to the main task, and the final result is calculated from the partial results.
